	                      :ftp => { 
	                        :host => 'ftp.domain.com', 
	                        :username => 'username', 
	                        :password => 'password' 
	                        :passive_mode => false,
	                        :timeout => 90,
	                        :verify_size_on_upload => false,

	                      }

Options storage, ftp, path and url are mandatory.

* +storage+: Should be set to 'ftp' value in order to utilize paperclipftp plugin
* +ftp_credentials+: Takes a path, a File, or a Hash. The path (or File) must point
  to a YAML file containing the +host+, +username+, and +password+ to ftp server.
  You can 'environment-space' this just like you do to your
  database.yml file, so different environments can use different accounts:
    development:
      host: domain.com
      username: user
      password: password
    test:
      ...
    production:
      ...
  This is not required, however, and the file may simply look like this:
    host: domain.com
    username: user
    password: password
  In which case, those values will be used in all environments.
* +path+: This is the templated path to the directory on the ftp server in which the file will be stored.
* +url+: This is the templated url to the files as accessed from CDN.

Other options are optional.

* +ftp_passive_mode+: True if ftp communication should happen in passive mode
* +ftp_timeout+: Max amount of time in seconds to allocate to ftp operations of the plugin
* +ftp_debug_mode+: If true, dumps copy of all ftp commands to stderr
* +ftp_verify_size_on_upload+: If true, file size will be verified after each upload
